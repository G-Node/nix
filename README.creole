The //Pandora// project started as an initiative of the Electrophysiology Task Force which is part of the [[INCF Datasharing Program|http://www.incf.org/core/programs/datasharing]]. As such the project aims to develop standardized methods and models for storing electrophysiology and other neuroscience data together with their metadata in one common file format based on HDF5.
