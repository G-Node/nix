About NIX
-------------

The NIX project started as an initiative of the Electrophysiology Task Force which is part of the INCF Datasharing Program. 
As such the project aims to develop standardized methods and models for storing electrophysiology and other neuroscience data together with their metadata in one common file format based on HDF5.

[See the wiki for more information](https://github.com/G-Node/nix/wiki)


Stability
---------

Please notice that this project is still under development.
Because of some major changes in the project structure, the HEAD of the master branch may not always compile on every system or may fail some test.
An older but more stable version of the NIX library can be found in the branch 'old_stable'.


Renaming NIX
----------------

Due to a name conflict with another project that is related to neuroscience, 'NIX' will be renamed to 'NIX'.
Renaming everything is an ongoing process, don't get confused if you find both names in the documentation and the source code.
